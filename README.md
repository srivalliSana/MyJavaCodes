here you can get java codes from basics to advanced level

This repository contains Java codes from basic level to advanced level.

The codes are organized into the following categories:

Basic: This category contains codes for beginners, such as Hello World, variables, data types, operators, and control flow statements.
Intermediate: This category contains codes for intermediate learners, such as classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, and exceptions.
Advanced: This category contains codes for advanced learners, such as threading, networking, and databases.
The codes are written in plain Java, without any frameworks or libraries. This makes them easy to understand and learn from.
